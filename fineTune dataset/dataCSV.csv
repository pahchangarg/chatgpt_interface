"""Instructions: [        1) Act as a software requirements engineer tasked to elicit system requirements of an application.        1) Generate only 5 additional questions first that would help more accurately answer the question         2) The questions should be in JSON format with a question ID        3) Use the delimiter 'SEP' after printing the additional questions.    ]    Task: [        You have to generate at least 50 system requirements in form of user stories for the Data Link application whose description is given below. You must display the additional questions first in JSON format, before generating the requirements. Generate an ID as well for the requirements.     ]     Description: [        The application is a comprehensive data management and user interface platform called DataLink. DataLink aims to streamline the data processing and user interface design workflows for government agencies, data users, UI designers, developers, and DevOps engineers. The objectives of DataLink are to improve data accuracy, enhance user experience, enable efficient collaboration, and ensure compliance with regulations.        DataLink provides a centralized platform where data users can easily process deletions and receive timely updates on FABS records. UI designers can leverage the application to redesign various pages, including the Resources page, Help page, Homepage, and DABS/FABS landing pages, ensuring a consistent and visually appealing user interface. They can also report on user testing outcomes to inform agencies about the impact of UI improvements on the overall user experience.        Developers benefit from DataLink's enhanced logging capabilities, enabling them to troubleshoot issues effectively and optimize the application's performance. They can also implement updates to reflect changes in publishStatus for FABS submissions and manage D Files generation requests efficiently. DevOps engineers rely on the integration with New Relic to gather valuable performance data across all applications, facilitating proactive monitoring and optimization.        End users, such as Broker users, website users, agency users, and general users, can access published FABS files, upload and validate data with accurate error messages, and stay informed about financial assistance updates. They can rely on DataLink's robust validation rules, which accommodate a large number of flexfields without compromising performance. The application ensures the accuracy and completeness of data, prevents duplicates, and provides users with comprehensive and informative error codes.        Overall, DataLink is a versatile application that addresses the needs of various stakeholders involved in data management, UI design, development, and compliance. It streamlines workflows, improves collaboration, and enhances the user experience, ultimately supporting the government's mission of transparent and efficient financial reporting.    ]    Output
