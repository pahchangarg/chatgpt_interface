It aims to streamline the estimation process and provide a seamless experience for moderators, estimators, participants, developers, and researchers. The application allows moderators to create and manage estimation games by entering a game name and optional description, and then inviting estimators through a unique URL. Moderators can start rounds by entering items to be estimated in a multi-line text field, and they have the flexibility to add, edit, or delete items as needed. The estimates are shown immediately, and the moderator can accept the average estimate or manually enter the agreed-upon estimate. The application supports re-estimation of stories and allows for importing and copying/pasting stories from spreadsheets for faster setup. Moderators can also browse previous games, view transcripts, and export them as HTML or CSV files. Account creation, login, and management functionalities are available for moderators. The application provides localized date and time display and offers password reminders via email. Moderators can choose the estimation scale, either modified Fibonacci sequence or powers of 2. The application accommodates up to 15 estimators, and participants can change their estimates until the last person selects a card. The two-minute countdown timer helps limit discussion time, and prior estimates are visible for comparison. Developers have focused on compliance with XHTML and CSS standards, database optimization, cross-browser compatibility, and adherence to W3C accessibility guidelines. The user experience emphasizes responsiveness, Unicode support, sensible URLs, and user-friendly error pages.

With the objective of facilitating dataset sharing and collaboration, the application offers a user-friendly interface and powerful functionality.        The motivation behind the Data Package Publisher is to provide a centralized platform where publishers can easily publish datasets according to their specific requirements. Publishers can choose between two options: publishing datasets privately, accessible only to a select group of people, or sharing them publicly with everyone. To begin using the application, publishers can sign up for an account using their GitHub or Google credentials, reducing the need for manual data entry and password management.                Once registered, publishers are guided on the next steps to take, ensuring a smooth onboarding experience. They can import their data packages into the registry, configuring their clients and using a publish command to update existing datasets, or unpublish and delete data packages if needed. The application emphasizes data validation, allowing publishers to validate data before publication and ensuring the accuracy and quality of the datasets. Real-time validation feedback is provided, enabling publishers to address any issues promptly.                For consumers, the Data Package Publisher offers a reliable and user-friendly environment for discovering, viewing, and downloading datasets. Consumers can search for data packages based on descriptions, view datasets online, and download them as a single file, eliminating the need for manual resource retrieval. They can also access comprehensive information about each data package, including download statistics, versioning details, and changes in schema, empowering them to make informed decisions about dataset usage.                Furthermore, the application supports collaboration and data management within organizations. Publishers can invite users to join their platform, manage roles and permissions, and maintain a clear overview of their organization's members. The application's administrative capabilities enable administrators to configure key parameters, monitor usage metrics, and implement a pricing plan and billing system to ensure the platform's sustainability.

Generate an ID as well for the requirements.     ]     Description = [        We are developing an event management application called BADCamp (Bay Area Drupal Camp) that aims to facilitate a seamless experience for attendees, trainers, training coordinators, sponsors, and administrators. The objectives of the application are to provide comprehensive information about the event, streamline registration and payment processes, manage training sessions and schedules, facilitate communication between participants, and promote sponsorship opportunities.        Motivated by the desire to enhance the overall event experience, BADCamp caters to various user needs. Anonymous users can view a list of sponsors and user profiles, allowing them to express gratitude towards sponsors and get to know fellow attendees. Training coordinators can easily communicate with trainers via email, reducing administrative efforts. Attendees can access a clear and interactive map to navigate the event venue, ensuring they reach their sessions on time. Trainers have the autonomy to edit their training node, including adding links to presentation slides. Trainees benefit from features such as limiting registrations to prevent duplicates, adding sessions to a personal schedule, and viewing their registered trainings.                The application also provides administrative views that assist training coordinators in tracking registration status, managing waitlists, and obtaining attendee information for specific sessions. Sponsors gain visibility through dedicated pages for each class, featuring logos, titles, trainers, location details, date and time, skill levels, remaining registrations, and registration links. Additionally, the application offers a training landing page, making it easier for anonymous users to explore and select desired trainings. Furthermore, the site incorporates blog posts, a newsletter signup, and a job board to keep users informed and engaged with BADCamp.                End users of the application include anonymous users who are interested in attending the camp, sponsors looking to promote their brand and engage with attendees, training coordinators responsible for organizing sessions, trainers conducting the training sessions, authenticated users who want to update their profiles or submit sessions, summit coordinators managing specific summits, and administrators overseeing the overall operation of BADCamp.                With BADCamp, we aim to create an intuitive, user-friendly platform that streamlines event management, fosters engagement, and enriches the experience for all participants. Whether it's finding information, registering for sessions, connecting with fellow attendees, or maximizing sponsorship opportunities, BADCamp serves as a comprehensive solution for organizing and participating in this Drupal-focused event.    ]    Output Format: [        {'QUE1': 'abc?', ..., 'QUE5': 'xyz?'

The primary objectives of the application are to provide repository managers with custodial control and management capabilities, ensure efficient and synchronized updates across all relevant information, and offer enhanced access and search functionalities for end users.         Motivated by the need for centralized repository management, our application enables repository managers to have a holistic view of the collections and objects for which they are responsible. They can easily update repository information in one place, knowing that the changes will be propagated consistently throughout the system. The application also allows repository managers to enforce access constraints, ensuring that only staff members of their unit and DAMS managers with universal access have curatorial privileges for their unit's assets.                For end users, the application offers comprehensive browsing and search capabilities. Users can browse and list all collections and objects within the DAMS belonging to a specific library unit. Additionally, they can contact repositories directly for inquiries or further information. The DAMS manager benefits from the ability to list and browse formal collections, along with their relationships, providing a comprehensive overview of the DAMS content.                The application provides repository managers with various tools to manage collections and objects effectively. They can identify and group collections based on provenance, create collections from existing collections and objects, and establish relationships between different collections. Repository managers can describe collections and objects in detail, including titles, dates, languages, and other relevant aspects. They can also indicate associated names, subjects, external descriptions, and events related to the collections and objects.                Furthermore, the application caters to the needs of repository managers in managing object components and content files. Repository managers can track and manage the components and files belonging to objects, describing them and indicating relevant information such as titles, dates, languages, copyright status, licenses, and rights. They can also represent the physical and logical structure of objects, link components and files, and ensure the integrity and authenticity of content files.                DAMS managers have access to features specifically designed for preservation management. They can monitor the integrity and obsolescence of master files by tracking aspects such as file size, creation date, file format, format version, checksums, and source-capture information. The application also enables DAMS managers to identify objects requiring attention, either due to integrity concerns or the need to update to a more current file format.                With its comprehensive features and user-friendly interface, our application serves as a powerful tool for repository managers, DAMS managers, and end users, facilitating efficient management, discovery, and access to digital collections and objects. Whether it's providing custodial control, enforcing access constraints, or enabling extensive search and browsing capabilities, our application aims to streamline the management and accessibility of digital assets while ensuring accurate and up-to-date information for all stakeholders.    ]    Output Format: [        {'QUE1': 'abc?', ..., 'QUE5': 'xyz?'
